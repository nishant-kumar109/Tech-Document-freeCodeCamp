      <p><strong>The Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. Usually that means JavaScript, although modelling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects is not part of the JavaScript language, as such.</p>

<p>The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style, or content. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them; once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.</p>

<li>A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</li>

<li>The W3C DOM and WHATWG DOM standards are implemented in most modern browsers. Many browsers extend the standard, so care must be exercised when using them on the web where documents may be accessed by various browsers with different DOMs.</li>

      <p>Before diving into the JavaScript Dom you should have the following basic background:</p>

      <li>A general understanding of the any markup language like HTML OR XML.</li>
      <li>Good working knowledge of Java Script.</li>
<li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try to code on free code camp in java Script.</li>
<li>The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API, but here we focus about js only</li>

    <header>DOM and JavaScript</header>
    <article>
    <p>The short example below, like nearly all of the examples in this reference, is JavaScript. That is to say, it's written in JavaScript, but it uses the DOM to access the document and its elements. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and their component parts (e.g. elements).</p>

<p>Every element in a document—the document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells—is part of the document object model for that document, so they can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.</p>
<p>In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were tightly intertwined, but eventually, they evolved into separate entities. The page content is stored in the DOM and may be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript, so that we may write this approximative equation:
      <br></br>
API (HTML or XML page) = DOM + JS (scripting language).</p>

The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API. Implementations of the DOM can be built for any language, as this Python example demonstrates:
<code>
# Python DOM example
import xml.dom.minidom as m
doc = m.parse(r"C:\Projects\Py\chap1.xml")
doc.nodeName # DOM property of document object
p_list = doc.getElementsByTagName("para")
</code>

Though we focus exclusively on JavaScript in this reference documentation.For example, the standard DOM specifies that the getElementsByTagName method in the code below must return a list of all the para (p tag) elements in the document:
	<code>var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("P");
// paragraphs[0] is the first para (p tag) element
// paragraphs[1] is the second para (p tag) element, etc.
alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);</code>
    </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="How_Do_I_Access_the_DOM?">
    <header>How Do I Access the DOM?</header>
    <p>You don't have to do anything special to begin using the DOM. Different browsers have different implementations of the DOM, and these implementations exhibit varying degrees of conformance to the actual DOM standard (a subject we try to avoid in this documentation), but every web browser uses some document object model to make web pages accessible via JavaScript.</p>
    <p>
When you create a script–whether it's inline in a script tag element or included in the web page by means of a script loading instruction–you can immediately begin using the API for the document or window elements to manipulate the document itself or to get at the children of that document, which are the various elements in the web page.<p> Your DOM programming may be something as simple as the following, which displays an alert message by using the alert() function from the window object, or it may use more sophisticated DOM methods to actually create new content, as in the longer example below.</p>
    </p>
   
    </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Applying_Dom">
    <header>Applying Dom</header>
    <article>
This following JavaScript will display an alert when the document is loaded (and when the whole DOM is available for use):
<code>
	< body onload="window.alert('Welcome to my home page!');">
	// * < and body tage will be together//
	</code>
      <p>
      Another example. This function creates a new H1 element, adds text to that element, and then adds the H1 to the tree for this document:<code>
       // run this function when the document is loaded
       window.onload = function() {
        // create a couple of elements in an otherwise empty HTML page
         var heading = document.createElement("h1");
         var heading_text = document.createTextNode("Big Head!");
         heading.appendChild(heading_text);
         document.body.appendChild(heading);
      }
      </code></p>

    <header>Important Data Types</header>
    <article>
     <p>This reference tries to describe the various objects and types in simple terms. But there are a number of different data types being passed around the API that you should be aware of. For the sake of simplicity, syntax examples in this API reference typically refer to nodes as elements, to arrays of nodes as nodeLists (or simply elements), and to attribute nodes simply as attributes.</p>

<p>The following table briefly describes these data types</p>
<ul>
	<li> <strong>Document : </strong>When a member returns an object of type document (e.g., the ownerDocument property of an element returns the document to which it belongs), this object is the root document object itself. The DOM document Reference chapter describes the document object.</li>
	<li><strong>Element :</strong>element refers to an element or a node of type element returned by a member of the DOM API. Rather than saying, for example, that the document.createElement() method returns an object reference to a node, we just say that this method returns the element that has just been created in the DOM. element objects implement the DOM.</li>
	<li><strong>NodeList :</strong>A nodeList is an array of elements, like the kind that is returned by the method document.getElementsByTagName(). Items in a nodeList are accessed by index in either of two ways:
   <li>list.item(1)</li>
   <li>list[1]</li>
These two are equivalent. In the first, item() is the single method on the nodeList object. The latter uses the typical array syntax to fetch the second item in the list.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute :</strong>When an attribute is returned by a member (e.g., by the createAttribute() method), it is an object reference that exposes a special (albeit small) interface for attributes. Attributes are nodes in the DOM just like elements are, though you may rarely use them as such.</li>
<li><strong>NamedNodeMap :</strong>A namedNodeMap is like an array, but the items are accessed by name or index, though this latter case is merely a convenience for enumeration, as they are in no particular order in the list. A namedNodeMap has an item() method for this purpose, and you can also add and remove items from a namedNodeMap.</li>
</ul>

<p>his guide is about the objects and the actual things you can use to manipulate the DOM hierarchy. There are many points where understanding how these work can be confusing. For example, the object representing the HTML form element gets its name property from the HTMLFormElement interface but its className property from the HTMLElement interface. In both cases, the property you want is simply in that form object.</p>

<p>But the relationship between objects and the interfaces that they implement in the DOM can be confusing, and so this section attempts to say a little something about the actual interfaces in the DOM specification and how they are made available.</p>
    </article>
    </section>

  <section class="main-section" id="Interfaces_and_Objects">
    <header>Interfaces and Objects</header>
    <article>
<p>Many objects borrow from several different interfaces. The table object, for example, implements a specialized HTMLTableElement interface, which includes such methods as createCaption and insertRow. But since it's also an HTML element, table implements the Element interface described in the DOM Element Reference chapter.</p>
And finally, since an HTML element is also, as far as the DOM is concerned, a node in the tree of nodes that make up the object model for an HTML or XML page, the table object also implements the more basic Node interface, from which Element derives.
<code>
var table = document.getElementById("table");
var tableAttrs = table.attributes; // Node/Element interface
for (var i = 0; i < tableAttrs.length; i++) {
// HTMLTableElement interface: border attribute
if(tableAttrs[i].nodeName.toLowerCase() == "border")
table.border = "1";
}
// HTMLTableElement interface: summary attribute
table.summary = "note: increased border";
</code>
When you get a reference to a table object, as in the following example, you routinely use all three of these interfaces interchangeably on the object, perhaps without knowing it.

    <header>Core Interfaces in the DOM</header>
    <article>
      <p>This section lists some of the most commonly-used interfaces in the DOM. The idea is not to describe what these APIs do here but to give you an idea of the sorts of methods and properties you will see very often as you use the DOM. These common APIs are used in the longer examples in the DOM Examples chapter at the end of this book.</p>
      <p>Document and window objects are the objects whose interfaces you generally use most often in DOM programming. In simple terms, the window object represents something like the browser, and the document object is the root of the document itself. Element inherits from the generic Node interface, and together these two interfaces provide many of the methods and properties you use on individual elements. These elements may also have specific interfaces for dealing with the kind of data those elements hold, as in the table object example in the previous section.</p>
      <p><strong>The following is a brief list of common APIs in web and XML page scripting using the DOM.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>document.getElementById(id)</li>
<li>document.getElementsByTagName(name)</li>
<li>document.createElement(name)</li>
<li>parentNode.appendChild(node)</li>
<li>element.innerHTML</li>
<li>element.style.left</li>
<li>element.setAttribute()</li>
<li>element.getAttribute()</li>
<li>element.addEventListener()</li>
<li>window.scrollTo()</li>
<li>console.log()</li>

    <header>Testing the DOM API</header>
    <article>
<p>This document provides samples for every interface that you can use in your own web development. In some cases, the samples are complete HTML pages, with the DOM access in a script-tag element, the interface (e.g, buttons) necessary to fire up the script in a form, and the HTML elements upon which the DOM operates listed as well. When this is the case, you can cut and paste the example into a new HTML document, save it, and run the example from the browser.</p>
<p>There are some cases, however, when the examples are more concise. To run examples that only demonstrate the basic relationship of the interface to the HTML elements, you may want to set up a test page in which interfaces can be easily accessed from scripts. The following very simple web page provides a script-tag element in the header in which you can place functions that test the interface, a few HTML elements with attributes that you can retrieve, set, or otherwise manipulate, and the web user interface necessary to call those functions from the browser.
<code>
    function setBodyAttr(attr, value){
      if (document.body) eval('document.body.'+attr+'="'+value+'"');
      else notSupported();
    }
</code>
</p>
<p>You can use this test page or create a similar one to test the DOM interfaces you are interested in and see how they work on the browser platform. You can update the contents of the test() function as needed, create more buttons, or add elements as necessary.</p>
<code>
	div style="margin: .5in; height: 400;">  
      form> 
        select onChange="setBodyAttr('text',
        this.options[this.selectedIndex].value);"> 
          option value="black">black 
          option value="darkblue">darkblue 
        /select>
        select onChange="setBodyAttr('bgColor',
        this.options[this.selectedIndex].value);"> 
          option value="white">white 
          option value="lightgrey">gray
        /select>
        select onChange="setBodyAttr('link',
        this.options[this.selectedIndex].value);">
          option value="blue">blue
          option value="green">green
        /select>
</code>
To test a lot of interfaces in a single page-for example, a "suite" of properties that affect the colors of a web page-you can create a similar test page with a whole console of buttons, textfields, and other HTML elements. The following screenshot gives you some idea of how interfaces can be grouped together for testin
<code>
	select onChange="setBodyAttr('link',
        this.options[this.selectedIndex].value);">
          option value="blue">blue
          option value="green">green
        /select>  small>
        a href="http://some.website.tld/page.html" id="sample">
        (sample link)
      /form>
      form>
        input type="button" value="version" onclick="ver()" />
      /form>
    /div>

    <article>This page describes how to use the DOM Core API in JavaScript to create and modify DOM objects. It applies to all Gecko-based applications (such as Firefox) both in privileged (extensions) and unprivileged (web pages) code.
    	<p><strong>Dynamically creating a DOM tree</strong></p>
    	Consider the following XML document:
<code>
	?xml version="1.0"?>
people>
  person first-name="eric" middle-initial="H" last-name="jung">
    address street="321 south st" city="denver" state="co" country="usa"/>
    address street="123 main st" city="arlington" state="ma" country="usa"/>
  /person>

  person first-name="jed" last-name="brown">
    address street="321 north st" city="atlanta" state="ga" country="usa"/>
    address street="123 west st" city="seattle" state="wa" country="usa"/>
    address street="321 south avenue" city="denver" state="co" country="usa"/>
  /person>
/people>
  </code><p>The W3C DOM API, supported by Mozilla, can be used to create an in-memory representation of this document like so</p>
<code>
var doc = document.implementation.createDocument("", "", null);
var peopleElem = doc.createElement("people");

var personElem1 = doc.createElement("person");
personElem1.setAttribute("first-name", "eric");
personElem1.setAttribute("middle-initial", "h");
personElem1.setAttribute("last-name", "jung");

var addressElem1 = doc.createElement("address");
addressElem1.setAttribute("street", "321 south st");
addressElem1.setAttribute("city", "denver");
addressElem1.setAttribute("state", "co");
addressElem1.setAttribute("country", "usa");
personElem1.appendChild(addressElem1);

var addressElem2 = doc.createElement("address");
addressElem2.setAttribute("street", "123 main st");
addressElem2.setAttribute("city", "arlington");

<p>DOM trees can be queried using XPath expressions, converted to strings or written to a local or remote files using XMLSerializer (without having to first convert to a string), POSTed to a web server (via XMLHttpRequest), transformed using XSLT, XLink, converted to a JavaScript object through a JXON algorithm, etc.</p>
<p><strong>You can automate the creation of a DOM tree using a JXON reverse algorithm in association with the following JSON representation</strong></p>

    "person": [{
      "address": [{
        "@street": "321 south st",
